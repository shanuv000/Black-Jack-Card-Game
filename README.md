## Getting Started

To start your BlackJack adventure, clone the repository and follow the installation instructions below. Vaibhav's creation awaits your command!

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Execute the program and input the number of players.

2. **Place Your Bets**: Each player places their bets, setting the stage for an exhilarating round.

3. **Receive Cards**: Watch as players and the dealer are dealt two cards each. Strive for a hand value as close to 21 as possible without surpassing it.

4. **Make Decisions**: Decide whether to 'hit' (draw another card) or 'stand' (retain your current hand). Strategy is key, as exceeding 21 results in a bust.

5. **Determine the Winner**: The player with the hand closest to 21 without busting emerges victorious.

6. **Repeat or Exit**: Players can choose to dive into another round or gracefully exit the game.
