## Overview

BlackJack, also known as 21, is a classic card game where the objective is to outscore the dealer without exceeding 21. Vaibhav has meticulously crafted this Python3 implementation, providing a sleek command line interface that transports you to the excitement of a real casino.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Immerse yourself in a sleek and intuitive command line interface designed for a captivating gaming experience.

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engage in an interactive gaming session that replicates the thrill of a live casino.

- **Flexible Betting**: Customize your bets, strategize your moves, and maximize your winnings with a flexible betting system.

- **Error Handling**: Experience a seamless gaming flow thanks to robust error handling, ensuring a hassle-free gameplay experience.

- **Learning Opportunity**: Perfect for Python enthusiasts, this project offers hands-on experience with classes, functions, loops, and conditional statements.

## Getting Started

To start your BlackJack adventure, clone the repository and follow the installation instructions below. Vaibhav's creation awaits your command!

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Execute the program and input the number of players.

2. **Place Your Bets**: Each player places their bets, setting the stage for an exhilarating round.

3. **Receive Cards**: Watch as players and the dealer are dealt two cards each. Strive for a hand value as close to 21 as possible without surpassing it.

4. **Make Decisions**: Decide whether to 'hit' (draw another card) or 'stand' (retain your current hand). Strategy is key, as exceeding 21 results in a bust.

5. **Determine the Winner**: The player with the hand closest to 21 without busting emerges victorious.

6. **Repeat or Exit**: Players can choose to dive into another round or gracefully exit the game.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shanuv000/Black-Jack-Card-Game
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd BlackJack
   ```

3. **Run the Game**:

   ```bash
   python3 blackjack.py
   ```
